# Route

To determine the correct response to a client, web server use **path and HTTP method** to lookup for the correct resource.

This process is known as **"routing"**.

We can define a route by calling **method named after HTTP verb**, passing a path and a function to execute when matched.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/', () => 'Landing')
    .get('/hello', () => 'Hi')
    .listen(3000)
```

We can access the web server by going to **http://localhost:3000**

This code allows us to create a simple web server running at port 3000, and tells Elysia to register the following path with the GET method, then response with following:

| Path   | Result  |
| ------ | ------- |
| /      | Landing |
| /hello | Hi      |

Accessing with browser works because **GET** is the default HTTP method.

## HTTP Verb

There are many HTTP method to use in a difference situation, for instance.

### GET

Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

### POST

The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

### PUT

The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

### DELETE

The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

---

To handle each of the different verbs, Elysia has a built-in API for several HTTP verbs by default, similar to `Elysia.get`

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/', () => 'hello')
    .post('/hi', () => 'hi')
    .listen(3000)
```

Elysia HTTP method accepts the following parameters:

-   **path**: Pathname
-   **function**: Function to response to client
-   **hook**: Additional metadata

You can read more about HTTP Verb on [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

## Handle

Most backend developer use REST Client like Postman, Insomnia or Hoppscotch to test their API.

However with Elysia, you can trigger a request to your Elysia server programmatically using `Elysia.handle`.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
    .get('/', () => 'hello')
    .post('/hi', () => 'hi')
    .listen(3000)

app.handle(new Request('http://localhost/')).then(console.log)
```

**Elysia.handle** is a function to process an actual request sending to the server.

Unlike unit test's mock, **you can expect it to behave like an actual request** sent to the server.

**Elysia.handle** is usually useful to simulate or creating unit tests.

## Custom Method

We can accept custom HHTP Method with `Elysia.route`.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
    .get('/', () => 'hello')
    .post('/', () => 'hi')
    .route('M-SEARCH', '/', () => 'connect')
    .listen(3000)
```

**Elysia.route** accepts the following:

-   **method**: HTTP Verb
-   **path**: Path
-   **function**: Function to response to client
-   **hook**: Additional metadata

When navigate to each method, you should see the results as the following:
| Path | Method | Result |
| - | --- | --- |
| / | GET | hello |
| / | POST | hi |
| / | M-SEARCH | connect |

::: tip
Based on [RFC 7231](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-4.1), HTTP Verb is case-sensitive.

It's recommended to use UPPERCASE convention for defining a custom HTTP Verb with Elysia.
:::

## Elysia.all

Elysia provide an `Elysia.all` for handling any HTTP verb for a specified path using the same API like **Elysia.get** and **Elysia.post**

```typescript
import {} from 'elysia'

new Elysia().all('/', () => 'hi').listen(3000)
```

Any HTTP verb that match the path, will be handled like the following:
| Path | Method | Result |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| / | GET | hi |
| / | POST | hi |
| / | DELETE | hi |

## 404

If no path match from defined routes, Elysia will pass the request to `error` lifecycle before returning a "NOT_FOUND" with an HTTP status of 404.

::: tip
HTTP Status is use to indicate the type of response. By default if everything is correct, server will return a '200 OK' status code (If route match and no error, Elysia will return 200 as default)

If server fail to find any route to handle, like in this case, then server shall return a '404 NOT FOUND' status code.
:::

For Elysia, we can handle a custom 404 error by returning a value from 'error` lifecycle like this:

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/', () => 'hi')
    .onError(({ code }) => {
        if (code === 'NOT_FOUND') return 'Route not found :('
    })
    .listen(3000)
```

When navigating to your web server, you should see the result as the following:

| Path | Method | Result              |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------- |
| /    | GET    | hi                  |
| /    | POST   | Route not found :\( |
| /hi  | GET    | Route not found :\( |
