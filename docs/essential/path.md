# Path

A path or pathname is an identifier to locate resources of a server.

```bash
http://localhost:/path/page
```

Elysia uses the path and method to look up the correct resource.

<div class="bg-white rounded-lg">
    <img src="/essential/url-object.svg" alt="URL Representation" />
</div>

A path starts after the origin. Prefix with **/** and ends before search query **(?)**

We can categorize the URL and path as follows:

| URL                             | Path         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| http://site.com/                | /            |
| http://site.com/hello           | /hello       |
| http://site.com/hello/world     | /hello/world |
| http://site.com/hello?name=salt | /hello       |
| http://site.com/hello#title     | /hello       |

::: tip
If the path is not specified, the browser and web server will treat the path as '/' as a default value.
:::

Elysia will look up each request for [route](/essential/route) and response using [handler](/essential/handler) function.

## Dynamic path

URLs can be both static and dynamic.

Static paths are hardcoded strings that can be used to locate resources of the server, while dynamic paths match some part and captures the value to extract extra information.

For instance, we can extract the user ID from the pathname. For example:

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/id/:id', ({ params: { id } }) => id)
                      // ^?
    .listen(3000)
```

<br>

Here dynamic path is created with `/id/:id` which tells Elysia to match any path up until `/id`. What comes after that is then stored as **params** object.

<Playground
  :elysia="demo1"
  :alias="{
    '/id/:id': '/id/1'
  }"
  :mock="{
    '/id/:id': {
      GET: '1'
    }
  }"
/>

When requested, the server should return the response as follows:

| Path                   | Response  |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| /id/1                  | 1         |
| /id/123                | 123       |
| /id/anything           | anything  |
| /id/anything?name=salt | anything  |
| /id                    | Not Found |
| /id/anything/rest      | Not Found |

Dynamic paths are great to include things like IDs, which then can be used later.

We refer to the named variable path as **path parameter** or **params** for short.

## Segment

URL segments are each path that is composed into a full path.

Segments are separated by `/`.
![Representation of URL segments](/essential/url-segment.webp)

Path parameters in Elysia are represented by prefixing a segment with ':' followed by a name.
![Representation of path parameter](/essential/path-parameter.webp)

Path parameters allow Elysia to capture a specific segment of a URL.

The named path parameter will then be stored in `Context.params`.

| Route     | Path   | Params  |
| --------- | ------ | ------- |
| /id/:id   | /id/1  | id=1    |
| /id/:id   | /id/hi | id=hi   |
| /id/:name | /id/hi | name=hi |

## Multiple path parameters

You can have as many path parameters as you like, which will then be stored into a `params` object.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/id/:id', ({ params: { id } }) => id)
    .get('/id/:id/:name', ({ params: { id, name } }) => id + ' ' + name)
                             // ^?
    .listen(3000)
```

<br>
<br>

<Playground
  :elysia="demo2"
  :alias="{
    '/id/:id': '/id/1',
    '/id/:id/:name': '/id/anything/rest'
  }"
  :mock="{
    '/id/:id': {
      GET: '1'
    },
    '/id/:id/:name': {
      GET: 'anything rest'
    }
  }"
/>

The server will respond as follows:

| Path                   | Response      |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| /id/1                  | 1             |
| /id/123                | 123           |
| /id/anything           | anything      |
| /id/anything?name=salt | anything      |
| /id                    | Not Found     |
| /id/anything/rest      | anything rest |

## Optional path parameters
Sometime we might want a static and dynamic path to resolve the same handler.

We can make a path parameter optional by adding a question mark `?` after the parameter name.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/id/:id?', ({ params: { id } }) => `id ${id}`)
                          // ^?
    .listen(3000)
```

<br>

<Playground
  :elysia="demo3"
  :alias="{
    '/id/:id': '/id/1'
  }"
  :mock="{
    '/id/:id': {
      GET: 'id 1'
    },
  }"
/>

The server will respond as follows:

| Path                   | Response      |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| /id                    | id undefined  |
| /id/1                  | id 1          |

## Wildcards

Dynamic paths allow capturing certain segments of the URL.

However, when you need a value of the path to be more dynamic and want to capture the rest of the URL segment, a wildcard can be used.

Wildcards can capture the value after segment regardless of amount by using "\*".

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/id/*', ({ params }) => params['*'])
                    // ^?
    .listen(3000)
```

<br>

<Playground
  :elysia="demo4"
  :alias="{
    '/id/:id': '/id/1',
    '/id/:id/:name': '/id/anything/rest'
  }"
  :mock="{
    '/id/:id': {
      GET: '1'
    },
    '/id/:id/:name': {
      GET: 'anything/rest'
    }
  }"
/>

In this case the server will respond as follows:

| Path                   | Response      |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| /id/1                  | 1             |
| /id/123                | 123           |
| /id/anything           | anything      |
| /id/anything?name=salt | anything      |
| /id                    | Not Found     |
| /id/anything/rest      | anything/rest |

Wildcards are useful for capturing a path until a specific point.

::: tip
You can use a wildcard with a path parameter.
:::

## Summary

To summarize, the path in Elysia can be grouped into 3 types:

-   **static paths** - static string to locate the resource
-   **dynamic paths** - segment can be any value
-   **wildcards** - path until a specific point can be anything

You can use all of the path types together to compose a behavior for your web server.

The priorities are as follows:

1. static paths
2. dynamic paths
3. wildcards

If the path is resolved as the static wild dynamic path is presented, Elysia will resolve the static path rather than the dynamic path

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/id/1', () => 'static path')
    .get('/id/:id', () => 'dynamic path')
    .get('/id/*', () => 'wildcard path')
    .listen(3000)
```

<Playground
  :elysia="demo5"
    :alias="{
    '/id/:id': '/id/2',
    '/id/*': '/id/2/a'
  }"
  :mock="{
    '/id/*': {
      GET: 'wildcard path'
    }
  }"
/>

Here the server will respond as follows:

| Path    | Response      |
| ------- | ------------- |
| /id/1   | static path   |
| /id/2   | dynamic path  |
| /id/2/a | wildcard path |
