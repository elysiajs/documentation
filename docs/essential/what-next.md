        content: The lifecycle event in ElysiaJS represents each stage of processing. A "Life Cycle" or "Hook" acts as an event listener, intercepting and responding to events throughout the process. Hooks enable you to customize and transform data within the pipeline, allowing you to fully optimize Elysia’s capabilities.
