# Context

Context is a request information passed to a [route handler](/handler).

Context is unique for each request, and is not shared except for `store` which is a global mutable state.

Elysia context consists of:

-   **path** - Pathname of the request
-   **body** - [HTTP message](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages), form or file upload.
-   **query** - [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string), include additional parameters for search query as JavaScript Object. (Query is extracted from a value after pathname starting from '?' question mark sign)
-   **params** - Elysia's path parameters parsed as JavaScript object
-   **headers** - [HTTP Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers), additional information about the request like User-Agent, Content-Type, Cache Hint.
-   **request** - [Web Standard Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
-   **redirect** - A function to redirect a response
-   **store** - A global mutable store for Elysia instance
-   **cookie** - A global mutable signal store for interacting with Cookie (including get/set)
-   **set** - Property to apply to Response:
    -   **status** - [HTTP status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), defaults to 200 if not set.
    -   **headers** - Response headers
    -   **redirect** - Response as a path to redirect to
-   **error** - A function to return custom status code

## Extending context

As Elysia only provides essential information, we can customize Context for our specific need for instance:
- extracting user ID as variable
- inject a common pattern repository
- add a database connection

---

We can extend Elysia's context by using the following APIs to customize the Context:

-   **state** - Create a global mutable state into **Context.store**
-   **decorate** - Add additional function or property assigned to **Context**
-   **derive** / **resolve** - Additional property based on existing property, uniquely assigned to each request.

::: tip
It's recommended to assign properties related to request and response, or frequently used functions to Context for separation of concerns.
:::

## Store

**State** is a global mutable object or state shared across the Elysia app.

If we are familiar with frontend libraries like React, Vue, or Svelte, there's a concept of Global State Management, which is also partially implemented in Elysia via state and store.

- **store** is a representation of a single-source-of-truth global mutable object for the entire Elysia app.

- **state** is a function to assign an initial value to **store**, which could be mutated later.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .state('version', 1)
    .get('/a', ({ store: { version } }) => version)
                // ^?
    .get('/b', ({ store }) => store)
    .get('/c', () => 'still ok')
    .listen(3000)
```

<Playground :elysia="demo1" />

Once **state** is called, value will be added to **store** property, and can be used in handler.

```typescript twoslash
// @errors: 2339

import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    // ❌ TypeError: counter doesn't exist in store
    .get('/error', ({ store }) => store.counter)
    .state('counter', 0)
    // ✅ Because we assigned a counter before, we can now access it
    .get('/', ({ store }) => store.counter)
```

<Playground :elysia="demo2" />

::: tip
Beware that we cannot use state value before assign.

Elysia registers state values into the store automatically without explicit type or additional TypeScript generic needed.
:::

## Decorate

**decorate** assigns an additional property to **Context** directly without prefix.

The difference is that the value should be read-only and not reassigned later.

This is an ideal way to assign additional functions, singleton, or immutable property to all handlers.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

class Logger {
    log(value: string) {
        console.log(value)
    }
}

new Elysia()
    .decorate('logger', new Logger())
    // ✅ defined from the previous line
    .get('/', ({ logger }) => {
        logger.log('hi')

        return 'hi'
    })
```

## Derive

Like `decorate`, we can assign an additional property to **Context** directly.

Instead of assign before server started, **derive** assigns when request happens.

Allowing us to "derive" (create a new property based on existing property).

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .derive(({ headers }) => {
        const auth = headers['authorization']

        return {
            bearer: auth?.startsWith('Bearer ') ? auth.slice(7) : null
        }
    })
    .get('/', ({ bearer }) => bearer)
```

<Playground :elysia="demo3" />

Because **derive** is assigned once a new request starts, **derive** can access Request properties like **headers**, **query**, **body** where **store**, and **decorate** can't.

Unlike **state**, and **decorate**. Properties that are assigned by **derive** are unique and not shared with another request.

::: tip
Derive is similar to resolve but store in a different queue.

**derive** is stored in [transform](/life-cycle/transform) queue while **resolve** stored in [beforeHandle](/life-cycle/before-handle) queue.
:::

## Pattern

**state**, **decorate** offers a similar APIs pattern for assigning property to Context as the following:

-   key-value
-   object
-   remap

Where **derive** can be only used with **remap** because it depends on existing value.

### key-value

We can use **state**, and **decorate** to assign a value using a key-value pattern.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

class Logger {
    log(value: string) {
        console.log(value)
    }
}

new Elysia()
    .state('counter', 0)
    .decorate('logger', new Logger())
```

This pattern is great for readability for setting a single property.

### Object

Assigning multiple properties is better contained in an object for a single assignment.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .decorate({
        logger: new Logger(),
        trace: new Trace(),
        telemetry: new Telemetry()
    })
```

The object offers a less repetitive API for setting multiple values.

### Remap

Remap is a function reassignment.

Allowing us to create a new value from existing value like renaming or removing a property.

By providing a function, and returning an entirely new object to reassign the value.

```typescript twoslash
// @errors: 2339
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .state('counter', 0)
    .state('version', 1)
    .state(({ version, ...store }) => ({
        ...store,
        elysiaVersion: 1
    }))
    // ✅ Create from state remap
    .get('/elysia-version', ({ store }) => store.elysiaVersion)
    // ❌ Excluded from state remap
    .get('/version', ({ store }) => store.version)
```

<Playground :elysia="demo4" />

It's a good idea to use state remap to create a new initial value from the existing value.

However, it's important to note that Elysia doesn't offer reactivity from this approach, as remap only assigns an initial value.

::: tip
Using remap, Elysia will treat a returned object as a new property, removing any property that is missing from the object.
:::

## Affix

To provide a smoother experience, some plugins might have a lot of property value which can be overwhelming to remap one-by-one.

The **Affix** function which consists of **prefix** and **suffix**, allowing us to remap all property of an instance.

```ts twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const setup = new Elysia({ name: 'setup' })
    .decorate({
        argon: 'a',
        boron: 'b',
        carbon: 'c'
    })

const app = new Elysia()
    .use(
        setup
            .prefix('decorator', 'setup')
    )
    .get('/', ({ setupCarbon, ...rest }) => setupCarbon)
```

<Playground :elysia="demo5" />

Allowing us to bulk remap a property of the plugin effortlessly, preventing the name collision of the plugin.

By default, **affix** will handle both runtime, type-level code automatically, remapping the property to camelCase as naming convention.

In some condition, we can also remap `all` property of the plugin:

```ts twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const setup = new Elysia({ name: 'setup' })
    .decorate({
        argon: 'a',
        boron: 'b',
        carbon: 'c'
    })

const app = new Elysia()
    .use(setup.prefix('all', 'setup')) // [!code ++]
    .get('/', ({ setupCarbon, ...rest }) => setupCarbon)
```

## Reference and value

To mutate the state, it's recommended to use **reference** to mutate rather than using an actual value.

When accessing the property from JavaScript, if we define a primitive value from an object property as a new value, the reference is lost, the value is treated as new separate value instead.

For example:

```typescript twoslash
const store = {
    counter: 0
}

store.counter++
console.log(store.counter) // ✅ 1
```

We can use **store.counter** to access and mutate the property.

However, if we define a counter as a new value

```typescript twoslash
const store = {
    counter: 0
}

let counter = store.counter

counter++
console.log(store.counter) // ❌ 0
console.log(counter) // ✅ 1
```

Once a primitive value is redefined as a new variable, the reference **"link"** will be missing, causing unexpected behavior.

This can apply to `store`, as it's a global mutable object instead.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .state('counter', 0)
    // ✅ Using reference, value is shared
    .get('/', ({ store }) => store.counter++)
    // ❌ Creating a new variable on primitive value, the link is lost
    .get('/error', ({ store: { counter } }) => counter)
```
