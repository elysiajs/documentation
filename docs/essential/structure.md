# Structure

Elysia is a pattern-agnostic framework, leaving the decision of which coding patterns to use up to you and your team.

However, there are several concerns about trying to adapt an MVC pattern [(Model-View-Controller)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) with Elysia, and we found it's hard to decouple and handle types.

This page is a guide on how to follow Elysia structure best practices combined with MVC pattern but can be adapted to any coding pattern you like.

## Method Chaining
Elysia code should always use **method chaining**.

As Elysia's type system is complex, every method in Elysia returns a new type reference.

**This is important** to ensure type integrity and inference.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .state('build', 1)
    // Store is strictly typed // [!code ++]
    .get('/', ({ store: { build } }) => build)
    .listen(3000)
```

In the code above **state** returns a new **ElysiaInstance** type, adding a `build` type.

### ❌ Don't: Use without method chaining
Without using method chaining, Elysia doesn't save these new types, leading to no type inference.

```typescript twoslash
// @errors: 2339
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()

app.state('build', 1)

app.get('/', ({ store: { build } }) => build)

app.listen(3000)
```

We recommend <u>**always using method chaining**</u> to provide an accurate type inference.

## Controller
> 1 Elysia instance = 1 controller

Elysia does a lot to ensure type integrity, if you pass an entire `Context` type to a controller, these might be the problems:

1. Elysia type is complex and heavily depends on plugin and multiple level of chaining
2. Hard to type, Elysia type could change at any time, especially with decorators, and store
3. Type casting may lead to a loss of type integrity or an inability to ensure consistency between types and runtime code
4. This makes it more challenging for [Sucrose](/blog/elysia-10#sucrose) *(Elysia's "kind of" compiler)* to statically analyze your code

### ❌ Don't: Create a separate controller
Don't create a separate controller, use Elysia itself as a controller instead:
```typescript
import { Elysia, t, type Context } from 'elysia'

abstract class Controller {
    static root(context: Context) {
        return Service.doStuff(context.stuff)
    }
}

// ❌ Don't
new Elysia()
    .get('/', Controller.hi)
```

Passing an entire `Controller.method` to Elysia is equivalent to having 2 controllers passing data back and forth. It's against the design of the framework and MVC pattern itself.

### ✅ Do: Use Elysia as a controller
Instead, treat an Elysia instance as a controller itself.
```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'
import { Service } from './service'

new Elysia()
    .get('/', ({ stuff }) => {
        Service.doStuff(stuff)
    })
```

## Service
Service is a set of utility/helper functions decoupled as a business logic to use in a module/controller, in our case, an Elysia instance.

Any technical logic that can be decoupled from controller may live inside a **Service**.

There're 2 types of service in Elysia:
1. Non-request dependent service
2. Request dependent service

### ✅ Do: Non-request dependent service
This kind of service doesn't need to access any property from the request or `Context`, and can be initiated as a static class same as usual MVC service pattern.

```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

abstract class Service {
    static fibo(number: number): number {
        if(number < 2)
            return number

        return Service.fibo(number - 1) + Service.fibo(number - 2)
    }
}

new Elysia()
    .get('/fibo', ({ body }) => {
        return Service.fibo(body)
    }, {
        body: t.Numeric()
    })
```

If your service doesn't need to store a property, you may use `abstract class` and `static` instead to avoid allocating class instance.

### Request Dependent Service
This kind of service may require some property from the request, and should be **initiated as an Elysia instance**.

### ❌ Don't: Pass entire `Context` to a service
**Context is a highly dynamic type** that can be inferred from Elysia instance.

Do not pass an entire `Context` to a service, instead use object destructuring to extract what you need and pass it to the service.
```typescript
import type { Context } from 'elysia'

class AuthService {
	constructor() {}

	// ❌ Don't do this
	isSignIn({ status, cookie: { session } }: Context) {
		if (session.value)
			return status(401)
	}
}
```

As Elysia type is complex, and heavily depends on plugin and multiple level of chaining, it can be challenging to manually type as it's highly dynamic.

### ✅ Do: Request dependent service as Elysia instance

We recommend abstracting service classes away from Elysia.

However, **if the service is a request dependent service** or needs to process HTTP requests, we recommend abstracting it as an Elysia instance to ensure type integrity and inference:

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

// ✅ Do
const AuthService = new Elysia({ name: 'Service.Auth' })
    .derive({ as: 'scoped' }, ({ cookie: { session } }) => ({
    	// This is equivalent to dependency injection
        Auth: {
            user: session.value
        }
    }))
    .macro(({ onBeforeHandle }) => ({
     	// This is declaring a service method
        isSignIn(value: boolean) {
            onBeforeHandle(({ Auth, status }) => {
                if (!Auth?.user || !Auth.user) return status(401)
            })
        }
    }))

const UserController = new Elysia()
    .use(AuthService)
    .get('/profile', ({ Auth: { user } }) => user, {
    	isSignIn: true
    })
```

::: tip
Elysia handle [plugin deduplication](/essential/plugin.html#plugin-deduplication) by default so you don't have to worry about performance, as it's going to be Singleton if you specified a **"name"** property.
:::

### ⚠️ Infers Context from Elysia instance

If **absolutely necessary**, you may infer the `Context` type from the Elysia instance itself:
```typescript
import { Elysia, type InferContext } from 'elysia'

const setup = new Elysia()
	.state('a', 'a')
	.decorate('b', 'b')

class AuthService {
	constructor() {}

	// ✅ Do
	isSignIn({ status, cookie: { session } }: InferContext<typeof setup>) {
		if (session.value)
			return status(401)
	}
}
```

However, we recommend avoiding this if possible, and using [Elysia as a service](✅-do-use-elysia-instance-as-a-service) instead.

You can learn more about [InferContext](/essential/handler#infercontext) in [Essential: Handler](/essential/handler).

## Model
Model or [DTO (Data Transfer Object)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) is handle by [Elysia.t (Validation)](/validation/overview.html#data-validation).

Elysia has a validation system built-in which can infers type from your code and validate it at runtime.

### ❌ Don't: Declare a class instance as a model

Do not declare a class instance as a model:
```typescript
// ❌ Don't
class CustomBody {
	username: string
	password: string

	constructor(username: string, password: string) {
		this.username = username
		this.password = password
	}
}

// ❌ Don't
interface ICustomBody {
	username: string
	password: string
}
```

### ✅ Do: Use Elysia's validation system

Instead of declaring a class or interface, use Elysia's validation system to define a model:
```typescript twoslash
// ✅ Do
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

const customBody = t.Object({
	username: t.String(),
	password: t.String()
})

// Optional if you want to get the type of the model
// Usually if we didn't use the type, as it's already inferred by Elysia
type CustomBody = typeof customBody.static
    // ^?



export { customBody }
```

We can get type of model by using `typeof` with `.static` property from the model.

Then you can use the `CustomBody` type to infer the type of the request body.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

const customBody = t.Object({
	username: t.String(),
	password: t.String()
})
// ---cut---
// ✅ Do
new Elysia()
	.post('/login', ({ body }) => {
	                 // ^?
		return body
	}, {
		body: customBody
	})
```

### ❌ Don't: Declare type separate from the model
Do not declare a type separate from the model, instead use `typeof` with `.static` property to get the type of the model.

```typescript
// ❌ Don't
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

const customBody = t.Object({
	username: t.String(),
	password: t.String()
})

type CustomBody = {
	username: string
	password: string
}

// ✅ Do
const customBody = t.Object({
	username: t.String(),
	password: t.String()
})

type customBody = typeof customBody.static
```

### Group
You can group multiple models into a single object to make it more organized.

```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

export const AuthModel = {
	sign: t.Object({
		username: t.String(),
		password: t.String()
	})
}
```

### Model Injection
Though this is optional, if you are strictly following MVC pattern, you may want to inject like a service into a controller. We recommended using [Elysia reference model](/essential/validation.html#reference-model)

Using Elysia's model reference
```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

const customBody = t.Object({
	username: t.String(),
	password: t.String()
})

const AuthModel = new Elysia()
    .model({
        'auth.sign': customBody
    })

const UserController = new Elysia({ prefix: '/auth' })
    .use(AuthModel)
    .post('/sign-in', async ({ body, cookie: { session } }) => {
                             // ^?

        return true
    }, {
        body: 'auth.sign'
    })
```

This approach provide several benefits:
1. Allow us to name a model and provide auto-completion.
2. Modify schema for later usage, or perform [remapping](/patterns/remapping.html#remapping).
3. Show up as "models" in OpenAPI compliance client, eg. OpenAPI.
4. Improve TypeScript inference speed as model type will be cached during registration.

As mentioned, Elysia is a pattern-agnostic framework, and we only provide a recommendation guide for handling Elysia with the MVC pattern.

It’s entirely up to you and your team whether to follow this recommendation based on your preferences and agreement.
