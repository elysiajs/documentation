# Quick Start
Elysia is optimized for Bun which is a JavaScript runtime that aims to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js.

You can install Bun with the command below:
```bash
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Automatic Installation
We recommend starting a new Elysia server using `bun create elysia`, which sets up everything automatically.

```bash
bun create elysia app
```

Once done, you should see the folder name `app` in your directory.

```bash
cd app
```

Start a development server by:
```bash
bun dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) should greet you with "Hello Elysia".

::: tip
Elysia ships you with `dev` command to automatically reload your server on file change.
:::

## Manual Installation
To manually create a new Elysia app, install Elysia as a package:

```typescript
bun add elysia
```

Open your `package.json` file and add the following scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun --watch src/index.ts",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production bun src/index.ts",
    "test": "bun test"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- **dev** - Start Elysia in development mode with auto-reload on code change.
- **start** - Start an Elysia production server.

If you are using TypeScript, make sure to create, and update `tsconfig.json` to include `compilerOptions.strict` to `true`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Structure
Here's the recommended file structure for Elysia if you don't strictly prefer a specific convention:
- **src** - Any file that associate with development of Elysia server.
    - **index.ts** - Entry point for your Elysia server, ideal place for setting global plugin
    - **setup.ts** - Composed of various plugins to be used as a Service Locator
    - **controllers** - Instances which encapsulate multiple endpoints 
    - **libs** - Utility functions
    - **models** - Data Type Objects (DTOs) for Elysia instance
    - **types** - Shared TypeScript type if needed
- **test** - Test file for Elysia server
