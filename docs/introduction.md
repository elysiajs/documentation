# Introduction
Elysia is an ergonomic web framework for building backend servers for Bun with JavaScript or TypeScript.

Design with simplicity and type safety in mind, allowing you to create a server with familiar APIs like Express and Fastify.

```typescript
new Elysia()
    .get('/', () => 'hi')
    .get('/id/:id', ({ params: { id }}) => id)
    .post('/form', ({ body }) => body)
    .listen(8080)
```

## Features
Our most loved features of Elysia that make Elysia stand out from other frameworks.

- **Performance** - Static code analysis to generate optimized code
- **Unified Type** - Shared DTO runtime and compile time validation
- **End-to-end Type Safety** - Sync your data both client and server
- **TypeScript** - Extensive type system for full TypeScript experience
- **JSX Template Engine** - Familiar experience for frontend developer
- **Ergonomic by design** - Simple and familiar API for building server

## Platform Agnostic
Elysia was designed but was **not limited to Bun**. Being [WinterCG compliant](https://wintercg.org/) allows you to deploy the Elysia server on Cloudflare Worker, Vercel Edge Function, and most other runtimes that support Web Standard Request.

## TypeScript
Elysia is designed to help you write less TypeScript.

Elysia's Type System is fine-tuned to infer your code into type automatically without needing to write explicit TypeScript while providing type-safety for both runtime and compile time to provide you with the most ergonomic developer experience.

TypeScript is not needed to use Elysia, but it's recommended to use Elysia with TypeScript.

## How to use the documentation
The documentation is **designed to be beginner-friendly**. Basic networking and server concepts will be briefly covered to help beginners understand how APIs work and the behavior of the framework.

There's **no correct way to learn Elysia**; however, we recommend completing the essential chapter first, as it covers most of Elysiaâ€™s features and foundations briefly before you dive into other topics that interest you.

As mentioned before, you can use Elysia with other runtimes beside Bun, but the __documentation will assume that you are using Bun__.

On the left side of your screen, you'll find a chapter navigation bar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced. You can follow them step-by-step to learn about building with Elysia. However, you can also read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll find a table of contents for each page. If you need to find content, **you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`).**

To get started, check out the Installation Guide.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
Although Elysia's documentation is designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Elysia's functionality. We will provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.

To get the most out of our documentation, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of Node.js and basic HTTP.
