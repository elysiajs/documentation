# GraphQL Yoga Plugin
This plugin integrates GraphQL yoga with Elysia

Install with:
```bash
bun add @elysiajs/graphql-yoga
```

Then use it:
```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'
import { yoga } from '@elysiajs/graphql-yoga'

const app = new Elysia()
    .use(
        yoga({
            typeDefs: /* GraphQL */`
                type Query {
                    hi: String
                }
            `,
            resolvers: {
                Query: {
                    hi: () => 'Hello from Elysia'
                }
            }
        })
    )
    .listen(8080)
```

Accessing `/graphql` in the browser (GET request) would show you a GraphiQL instance for the GraphQL-enabled Elysia server.

optional: you can install a custom version of optional peer dependencies as well:
```bash
bun add graphql graphql-yoga
```

## Resolver
Elysia uses [Mobius](https://github.com/saltyaom/mobius) to infer type from **typeDefs** field automatically, allowing you to get full type-safety and auto-complete when typing **resolver** types.

## Context
You can add custom context to the resolver function by adding **context**
```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'
import { yoga } from '@elysiajs/graphql-yoga'

const app = new Elysia()
    .use(
        yoga({
            typeDefs: /* GraphQL */`
                type Query {
                    hi: String
                }
            `,
            context: {
                name: 'Mobius'
            },
            // If context is a function on this doesn't present
            // for some reason it won't infer context type
            useContext(_) {},
            resolvers: {
                Query: {
                    hi: async (parent, args, context) => context.name
                }
            }
        })
    )
    .listen(8080)
```
