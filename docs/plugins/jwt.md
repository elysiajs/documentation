# JWT Plugin
This plugin adds support for using JWT in Elysia handler

Install with:
```bash
bun add @elysiajs/jwt
```

Then use it:
```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'
import { cookie } from '@elysiajs/cookie'
import { jwt } from '@elysiajs/jwt'

const app = new Elysia()
    .use(
        jwt({
            name: 'jwt',
            secret: 'Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort'
        })
    )
    .use(cookie())
    .get('/sign/:name', async ({ jwt, cookie, setCookie, params }) => {
        setCookie('auth', await jwt.sign(params), {
            httpOnly: true,
            maxAge: 7 * 86400,
        })

        return `Sign in as ${cookie.auth}`
    })
    .get('/profile', async ({ jwt, set, cookie: { auth } }) => {
        const profile = await jwt.verify(auth)

        if (!profile) {
            set.status = 401
            return 'Unauthorized'
        }

        return `Hello ${profile.name}`
    })
    .listen(8080)
```

## Config
This plugin extends config from [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose).

Below is a config which is accepted by the plugin.

### name
Name to register `jwt` function as.

For example, `jwt` function will be registered with a custom name.
```typescript
app
    .use(
        jwt({
            name: 'myJWTNamespace',
            secret: process.env.JWT_SECRETS
        })
    )
    .get('/sign/:name', ({ myJWTNamespace, params }) => {
        return myJWTNamespace.sign(params)
    })
```

Because some might need to use multiple `jwt` with different configs in a single server, explicitly registering the JWT function with a different name is needed.

### secret
The private key to sign JWT payload with.

### schema
Type strict validation for JWT payload.

---
Below is a config that extends from [cookie](https://npmjs.com/package/cookie)

### alg
@default `HS256`

Signing Algorithm to sign JWT payload with.

Possible property for jose are:
HS256
HS384
HS512
PS256
PS384
PS512
RS256
RS384
RS512

### iss
The issuer claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT as per [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.1)

TLDR; is usually (the domain) name of the signer.

### sub
The subject claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT.

The claims in a JWT are normally statements about the subject as per [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)

### aud
The audience claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for.

Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST identify itself with a value in the audience claim as per [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.3)

### jtit
JWT ID claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT as per [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.7)

### nbf
The "not before" claim identifies the time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing as per [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.5)

### exp
The expiration time claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing as per [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)

### iat
The "issued at" claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued.  

This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT as per [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.6)
 
### b64
This JWS Extension Header Parameter modifies the JWS Payload representation and the JWS Signing input computation as per [RFC7797](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7797).

### kid
A hint indicating which key was used to secure the JWS. 

This parameter allows originators to explicitly signal a change of key to recipients as per [RFC7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.4)

### x5t
(X.509 certificate SHA-1 thumbprint) header parameter is a base64url-encoded SHA-1 digest of the DER encoding of the X.509 certificate [RFC5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280) corresponding to the key use to digitally sign the JWS as per [RFC7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.7)

### x5c
(X.509 certificate chain) header parameter contains the X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280) corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the JWS as per [RFC7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.6)

### x5u
(X.509 URL) header parameter is a URI [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) that refers to a resource for the X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280] corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the JWS as per [RFC7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.5)

### jwk
The "jku" (JWK Set URL) Header Parameter is a URI [RFC3986] that refers to a resource for a set of JSON-encoded public keys, one of which corresponds to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.

The keys MUST be encoded as a JWK Set [JWK] as per [RFC7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.2)

### typ
The `typ` (type) Header Parameter is used by JWS applications to declare the media type [IANA.MediaTypes] of this complete JWS.

This is intended for use by the application when more than one kind of object could be present in an application data structure that can contain a JWS as per [RFC7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.9)

### ctr
Content-Type parameter is used by JWS applications to declare the media type [IANA.MediaTypes] of the secured content (the payload).

This is intended for use by the application when more than one kind of object could be present in the JWS Payload as per [RFC7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1.9)

## Handler
Below are the value added to the handler.

### jwt.sign
A dynamic object of collection related to use with JWT registered by JWT plugin.

Type:
```typescript
sign: (payload: JWTPayloadSpec): Promise<string>
```

`JWTPayloadSpec` accept the same value as [JWT config](#config)

### jwt.verify
Verify payload with provided JWT config

Type:
```typescript
verify(payload: string) => Promise<JWTPayloadSpec | false>
```

`JWTPayloadSpec` accept the same value as [JWT config](#config)

## Pattern
Below you can find the common patterns to use the plugin.

## Set JWT expire date
By default, the config is passed to `setCookie` and inherits its value.

```typescript
const app = new Elysia()
    .use(
        jwt({
            name: 'jwt',
            secret: 'kunikuzushi',
            exp: '7d'
        })
    )
    .get('/sign/:name', async ({ jwt, params }) => jwt.sign(params))
```

This will sign JWT with an expiration date of the next 7 days.
