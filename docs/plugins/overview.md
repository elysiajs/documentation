# Overview

Elysia is designed to be modular and lightweight.

Following the same idea as Arch Linux (btw, I use Arch):

> Design decisions are made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus

This is to ensure developers end up with a performant web server they intend to create. By extension, Elysia includes pre-built common pattern plugins for convenient developer usage:
