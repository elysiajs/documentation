# Trace

Trace is an API to measure the performance of your server.

Trace allows us to interact with the duration span of each life-cycle events and measure the performance of each function to identify performance bottlenecks of the server.

![Example of usage of Trace](/assets/trace.webp)

Performance is an important aspect for Elysia.

We don't want to be fast for benchmarking purposes, we want you to have a real fast server in real-world scenario.

There are many factors that can slow down our app - and it's hard to identify them, but **trace** can helps solve that problem

## Trace

Trace can measure life cycle execution time of each function to audit the performance bottleneck of each cycle.

```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
    .trace(async ({ handle }) => {
        const { time, end } = await handle

        console.log('beforeHandle took', (await end) - time)
    })
    .get('/', () => 'Hi')
    .listen(3000)
```

You can trace life cycle of the following:

-   **request** - get notified of every new request
-   **parse** - array of functions to parse the body
-   **transform** - transform request and context before validation
-   **beforeHandle** - custom requirement to check before the main handler, can skip the main handler if response returned.
-   **handle** - function assigned to the path
-   **afterHandle** - map returned value into a proper response
-   **error** - handle error thrown during processing request
-   **response** - send a Response back to the client

Please refer to [Life Cycle Events](/essential/life-cycle#events) for more information:
![Elysia Life Cycle](/assets/lifecycle.webp)

## Children

You can tap deeper and measure each function of a life-cycle event by using the **children** property of a life-cycle event

```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const sleep = (time = 1000) =>
    new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time))

const app = new Elysia()
    .trace(async ({ beforeHandle }) => {
        for (const child of children) {
            const { time: start, end, name } = await child

            console.log(name, 'took', (await end) - start, 'ms')
        }
    })
    .get('/', () => 'Hi', {
        beforeHandle: [
            function setup() {},
            async function delay() {
                await sleep()
            }
        ]
    })
    .listen(3000)
```

::: tip
Every life cycle has support for children except for `handle`
:::

## Name

Measuring functions by index can be hard to trace back to the function code, that's why trace provides a **name** property to easily identify the function by name.

```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
	.trace(async ({ beforeHandle }) => {
		for (const child of children) {
			const { name } = await child

			console.log(name)
            // setup
            // anonymous
		}
	})
	.get('/', () => 'Hi', {
		beforeHandle: [
			function setup() {},
			() => {}
		]
	})
	.listen(3000)
```

::: tip
If you are using an arrow function or unnamed function, **name** will become **"anonymous"**
:::

## Set

Inside the trace callback, you can access `Context` of the request, and can mutate the value of the request itself, for example using `set.headers` to update headers.

This is useful when you need support an API like Server-Timing.

![Example of usage of Trace](/assets/server-timing.webp)

```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
    .trace(async ({ handle, set }) => {
        const { time, end } = await handle

        set.headers['Server-Timing'] = `handle;dur=${(await end) - time}`
    })
    .get('/', () => 'Hi')
    .listen(3000)
```

::: tip
Using `set` inside `trace` can affect performance, as Elysia defers the execution to the next micro-tick.
:::

## Skip

Sometimes, `beforeHandle` or handler can throw an error, skipping the execution of some lifecycles.

By default if this happens, each life-cycle will be resolved automatically, and you can track if the API is executed or not by using `skip` property

```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
    .trace(async ({ handle, set }) => {
        const { time, end, skip } = await handle

        console.log(skip)
    })
    .get('/', () => 'Hi', {
        beforeHandle() {
            throw new Error("I'm a teapot")
        }
    })
    .listen(3000)
```
