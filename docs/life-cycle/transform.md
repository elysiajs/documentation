# Transform
Executed just before **Validation** process, designed to mutate context to conform with the validation or appending new value.

It's recommended to use transform for the following:
- Mutate existing context to conform with validation.
- `derive` is based on `onTransform` with support for providing type.

## Example
Below is an example of using transform to mutate params to be numeric values.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .get('/id/:id', ({ params: { id } }) => id, {
        params: t.Object({
            id: t.Number()
        }),
        transform({ params }) {
            const id = +params.id

            if(!Number.isNaN(id))
                params.id = id
        }
    })
    .listen(3000)
```

## Derived
Using `derived` and `transform` is stored in the same queue.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .onTransform(() => {
        console.log(1)
    })
    .derived(() => {
        console.log(2)

        return {}
    })
```

The console should log as the following:

```bash
1
2
```

## Derive
Designed to append new value to context directly before validation process storing in the same stack as **transform**.

Unlike **state** and **decorate** that assigned value before the server started. **derive** assigns a property when each request happens. Allowing us to extract a piece of information into a property instead.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .derive(({ headers }) => {
        const auth = headers['Authorization']

        return {
            bearer: auth.startsWith('Bearer ') ? auth.slice(7) : null
        }
    })
    .get('/', ({ bearer }) => bearer)
```

Because **derive** is assigned once a new request starts, **derive** can access Request properties like **headers**, **query**, **body** where **store**, and **decorate** can't.

Unlike **state**, and **decorate**. Properties which assigned by **derive** is unique and not shared with another request.
