# WebSocket

WebSocket is a realtime protocol for communication between your client and server.

Unlike HTTP where our client repeatedly asking the website for information and waiting for a reply each time, WebSocket sets up a direct line where our client and server can send messages back and forth directly, making the conversation quicker and smoother without having to start over each message.

SocketIO is a popular library for WebSocket, but it is not the only one. Elysia uses [uWebSocket](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) which Bun use under the hood with the same API.

To use websocket, simply call `Elysia.ws()`:
```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
    .ws('/ws', {
        message(ws, message) {
            ws.send(message)
        }
    })
    .listen(8080)
```

## WebSocket message validation:

Same as normal route, WebSockets also accepts a **schema** object to strictly type and validate requests.

```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
    .ws('/ws', {
        // validate incoming message
        body: t.Object({
            message: t.String()
        }),
        message(ws, { message }) {
            ws.send({
                message,
                time: Date.now()
            })
        }
    })
    .listen(8080)
```

WebSocket schema can validate the following:

-   **message** - An incoming message.
-   **query** - query string or URL parameters.
-   **params** - Path parameters.
-   **header** - Request's headers.
-   **cookie** - Request's cookie
-   **response** - Value returned from handler

By default Elysia will parse incoming stringified JSON message as Object for validation.

## Configuration
You can set Elysia constructor to set the Web Socket value.
```ts
new Elysia({
    websocket: {
        idleTimeout: 30
    }
})
```

Elysia's WebSocket implementation extends Bun's WebSocket configuration, please refer to [Bun's WebSocket documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/api/websockets) for more information.

The following are a brief configuration from [Bun WebSocket](https://bun.sh/docs/api/websockets#create-a-websocket-server)

### perMessageDeflate

@default `false`

Enable compression for clients that support it.

By default, compression is disabled.

### maxPayloadLength

The maximum size of a message.

### idleTimeout

@default `120`

After a connection has not received a message for this many seconds, it will be closed.

### backpressureLimit

@default `16777216` (16MB)

The maximum number of bytes that can be buffered for a single connection.

### closeOnBackpressureLimit

@default `false`

Close the connection if the backpressure limit is reached.

## Methods

Below are the new methods that are available to the WebSocket route

## ws

Create a websocket handler

Example:

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
    .ws('/ws', {
        message(ws, message) {
            ws.send(message)
        }
    })
    .listen(8080)
```

Type:

```typescript
.ws(endpoint: path, options: Partial<WebSocketHandler<Context>>): this
```

endpoint: A path to exposed as websocket handler
options: Customize WebSocket handler behavior

## WebSocketHandler

WebSocketHandler extends config from [config](#config).

Below is a config which is accepted by `ws`.

## open

Callback function for new websocket connection.

Type:

```typescript
open(ws: ServerWebSocket<{
    // uid for each connection
    id: string
    data: Context
}>): this
```

## message

Callback function for incoming websocket message.

Type:

```typescript
message(
    ws: ServerWebSocket<{
        // uid for each connection
        id: string
        data: Context
    }>,
    message: Message
): this
```

`Message` type based on `schema.message`. Default is `string`.

## close

Callback function for closing websocket connection.

Type:

```typescript
close(ws: ServerWebSocket<{
    // uid for each connection
    id: string
    data: Context
}>): this
```

## drain

Callback function for the server is ready to accept more data.

Type:

```typescript
drain(
    ws: ServerWebSocket<{
        // uid for each connection
        id: string
        data: Context
    }>,
    code: number,
    reason: string
): this
```

## parse

`Parse` middleware to parse the request before upgrading the HTTP connection to WebSocket.

## beforeHandle

`Before Handle` middleware which execute before upgrading the HTTP connection to WebSocket.

Ideal place for validation.

## transform

`Transform` middleware which execute before validation.

## transformMessage

Like `transform`, but execute before validation of WebSocket message

## header

Additional headers to add before upgrade connection to WebSocket.
