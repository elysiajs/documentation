# Deploy to production
This page is a guide on how to deploy Elysia to production.

## Compile to binary
We recommended running a build command before deploying to produciton as it could potentially reduce memory usage and file size significantly.

We recommended compile Elysia into a single binary using the command as follows:
```bash
bun build \
	--compile \
	--minify-whitespace \
	--minify-syntax \
	--target bun \
	--outfile server \
	./src/index.ts
```

This will generate a portable binary `server` which we can run to start our server.

Compiling server to binary usually significantly reduce memory usage by 2-3x compared to development environment.

This command is a bit long, so let's break it down:
1. `--compile` - Compile TypeScript to binary
2. `--minify-whitespace` - Remove unnecessary whitespace
3. `--minify-syntax` - Minify JavaScript syntax to reduce file size
4. `--target bun` - Target the `bun` platform, this can optimize the binary for the target platform
5. `--outfile server` - Output the binary as `server`
6. `./src/index.ts` - The entry file of our server (codebase)

To start our server, simly run the binary.
```bash
./server
```

Once binary is compiled, you don't need `Bun` installed on the machine to run the server.

This is great as the deployment server doesn't need to install an extra runtime to run making binary portable.

### Why not --minify
Bun does have `--minify` flag that will minify the binary.

However if we are using [OpenTelemetry](/plugin/opentelemetry), it's going to reduce a function name to a single character.

This make tracing harder than it should as OpenTelemetry rely on a function name.

However, if you're not using OpenTelemetry, you may opt in for `--minify` instead
```bash
bun build \
	--compile \
	--minify \
	--target bun \
	--outfile server \
	./src/index.ts
```

### Permission
Some Linux distro might not be able to run the binary, we suggest enable executable permission to a binary if you're on Linux:
```bash
chmod +x ./server

./server
```

### Unknown random Chinese error
If you're trying to deploy a binary to your server but unable to run with random chinese character error.

It means that the machine you're running on **doesn't support AVX2**.

Unfortunately, Bun require machine that has an `AVX2` hardware support.

There's no workaround as far as we know.

## Compile to JavaScript
If you are unable to compile to binary or you are deploying on a Window server.

You may bundle your server to a JavaScript file instead.

```bash
bun build \
	--compile \ // [!code --]
	--minify-whitespace \
	--minify-syntax \
	--target bun \
	--outfile ./dist/index.js \
	./src/index.ts
```

This will generate a single portable JavaScript file that you can deploy on your server.
```bash
NODE_ENV=production bun ./dist/index.js
```

## Docker
On Docker, we recommended to always compile to binary to reduce base image overhead.

Here's an example image using Distroless image using binary.
```dockerfile [Dockerfile]
FROM oven/bun AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Cache packages installation
COPY package.json package.json
COPY bun.lockb bun.lockb

RUN bun install

COPY ./src ./src

ENV NODE_ENV=production

RUN bun build \
	--compile \
	--minify-whitespace \
	--minify-syntax \
	--target bun \
	--outfile server \
	./src/index.ts

FROM gcr.io/distroless/base

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build /app/server server

ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD ["./server"]

EXPOSE 3000
```

### Monorepo
If you are using Elysia with Monorepo, you may need to include dependent `packages`.

If you are using Turborepo, you may place a Dockerfile inside an your apps directory like **apps/server/Dockerfile**. This may apply to other monorepo manager such as Lerna, etc.

Assume that our monorepo are using Turborepo with structure as follows:
- apps
	- server
		- **Dockerfile (place a Dockerfile here)**
- packages
	- config

Then we can build our Dockerfile on monorepo root (not app root):
```bash
docker build -t elysia-mono .
```

With Dockerfile as follows:
```dockerfile [apps/server/Dockerfile]
FROM oven/bun:1 AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Cache packages
COPY package.json package.json
COPY bun.lockb bun.lockb

COPY /apps/server/package.json ./apps/server/package.json
COPY /packages/config/package.json ./packages/config/package.json

RUN bun install

COPY /apps/server ./apps/server
COPY /packages/config ./packages/config

ENV NODE_ENV=production

RUN bun build \
	--compile \
	--minify-whitespace \
	--minify-syntax \
	--target bun \
	--outfile server \
	./src/index.ts

FROM gcr.io/distroless/base

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build /app/server server

ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD ["./server"]

EXPOSE 3000
```

## Railway
[Railway](https://railway.app) is one of the popular deployment platform.

Railway assign **random port** to expose for each deployment that can be access via `PORT` environment variable.

We need to modify our Elysia server to accept `PORT` environment to comply with Railway port.

Instead of a fixed port, we may use `process.env.PORT` and provide a fallback on development instead.
```ts
new Elysia()
	.listen(3000) // [!code --]
	.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 3000) // [!code ++]
```

This should allows Elysia to intercept port provided by Railway.

::: tip
Elysia assign hostname to `0.0.0.0` automatically, which works with Railway
